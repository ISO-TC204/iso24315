When ready, the rule signer approves the translated rule by adding an electronic signature, as depicted by the green shield. Ideally, the rule maker creates the rule electronically and signs the rule when ready (i.e., a single person can act as the rule maker, translator, and rule signer).</p><p>Once a rule is signed, it is expected to be fairly static; however, certain metadata about the rule can change more frequently. For example, when the regulation system provides rules to a distribution system, it is entering into an agreement that the information will be accurate for a period of time (i.e., the freshness period). This allows the distribution system to provide the information to METR users with confidence that it is accurate and for METR users to rely upon this information even if they temporarily lose connectivity to their distributor. The freshness period is likely to change reasonably frequently, but updating the freshness period should not require the rule signer (e.g., the agency traffic engineer or public official) to resign the rules. Instead, this is operational information that can be delegated to the operational staff of the regulation system. Likewise, when discrepancies are discovered, the metadata can be immediately updated to notify other METR users without requiring the rule to be resigned. Nonetheless, the receiver needs to be confident that this metadata is also trustworthy. To enable this, each rule set issued by the regulation system is associated with metadata, depicted as a purple note attached to the scroll, and signed, which is depicted as a purple shield.&nbsp;</p><p>When another system (e.g., the distribution system) needs a copy of these rules, it uses a secure communications channel (e.g., protected by TLS 1.3), which is depicted as a purple envelope with its own purple shield that contains the entire rule set, including the metadata and signatures.&nbsp;</p><p>A distribution system will typically collect multiple rule sets from multiple regulation systems.
