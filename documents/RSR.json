The METR network is responsible for delivering rules entered by a translator to (typically mobile) user systems. The user system is responsible for interpreting these rules along with supporting data from other sources (e.g., visually observed rules, current traffic conditions, and other factors) and providing interpreted results to the user, as needed. The METR network also includes the ability to report observations from the field back to the central office to ensure that the electronic data store is consistent with the rules posted in the field.</p><p>For more information, please refer to the SoSR.</p>"},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2023-08-15T15:13:41.117Z"},{"attributesChanged":{"type":null},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2023-08-15T20:56:35.168Z"}]},{"id":"540","guid":"a8573864-9bf2-417a-8bca-f85b8fbbaae9","heading":"Regulation system overview","type":"s","history":[{"affectedNodeId":"182","changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2024-05-30T06:43:00.930Z","docId":"RSR","structureAction":"Create"},{"attributesChanged":{"heading":null},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2024-05-30T06:43:14.437Z"},{"attributesChanged":{"type":null},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2024-05-30T07:57:42.786Z"}],"children":[{"id":"352","guid":"4bcd1df7-5edd-497d-8ed4-798d6ab8b3c5","heading":"General","text":"<p>Figure 1 identifies the incoming and outgoing information flows for a METR regulation system (MRS) per the reference architecture, which is defined in full in Clause 8 of the SoSR (ISO 24315-3).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","type":"s","attachments":["RSR-352_1_24315-4_ed1fig1.png"],"discussion":[{"comment":"<p>Add Graphic</p>","date":"2023-08-15T23:13:25.341Z","author":{"name":"Kenneth Vaughn","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","company":"Trevilon"}}],"history":[{"affectedNodeId":"182","changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2023-08-15T15:08:59.165Z","docId":"RSR","structureAction":"Create"},{"attributesChanged":{"heading":null},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2023-08-15T15:09:14.985Z"},{"attributesChanged":{"text":null},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2023-08-15T15:09:32.603Z"},{"attributesChanged":{"text":"<p>For the purpose of this document, regulation systems are categorized into three types based on the reference architecture:</p><p>— &nbsp; &nbsp;centre-based regulation systems for pre-announced rules</p><p>— &nbsp; &nbsp;centre-based regulation systems for emergent rules</p><p>— &nbsp; &nbsp;localized regulation systems</p><p>While any of the three regulation systems can theoretically be used to enter any type of rule, the deployment scenarios and minimum conformance requirements vary.
