In the near-term, it is expected to assist ADS/ADAS vehicles to discover information in advance and to more clearly disambiguate details (e.g. some text on sign might be hard to read or sign might be partially obstructed), but our assumption is that vehicles must provide for sufficiently safe operations even if conditions are not completely entered within METR when the jurisdiction claims to support METR (e.g., it should be able to detect a lane closure and respond appropriately; it should be able to detect that it is going well above the prevailing speed and slow down as needed).
