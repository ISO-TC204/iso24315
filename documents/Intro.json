The METR reference architecture is refined to provide regional implementation guidance. For example, in Europe, METR can eventually become part of the National Access point (NAP). Furthermore, legacy data formats including TN-ITS, DATEX-II, TPEG2, TransModel, TMDD, and WZDx can be refined to support METR requirements or used as-is to deliver METR information to the extent that the data can be supported (i.e., non-METR distribution). The preferred solution is to update these formats to conform to the full set of METR trustworthiness requirements.</p>"
