However, some vehicle owners like performing routine maintenance themselves, in which case the vehicle might only visit a certified maintenance facility when required for an inspection (e.g., annually) – and as some jurisdictions do not require inspections, some vehicles may seldom if ever visit a certified maintenance facility.</p><p>If a vehicle is disabled, it can be towed to a facility. Due to the size and shape of vehicles, towing expenses can be significant, especially when located in remote areas. Thus, it is desirable to provide alternatives to towing when possible. For example, there should be a way to update regulations on a vehicle or to operate it with old regulations – even when it has been offline with a dead battery for a prolonged period.</p><p>Technology devices (e.g., smartphones, Vehicle OBEs) are replaced by travellers as needed. Most smartphones have a lifespan of less than five years and are wirelessly updated multiple times per year while OBEs are likely to have a lifespan more similar to the lifespan of their host vehicle (i.e., 10-20 years) and will likely be updated less often.&nbsp;</p><p>Applications on technology devices should always be certified to ensure that they do not violate security of other applications on the same technology device. When these devices are connected, the applications are frequently updated as needed, while unconnected devices are frequently never updated.</p>"

Today, developers of driving automation systems are responsible for digitizing all relevant rules for their driving automation system. This means that each developer must codify at least the default set of relevant rules for any environment in which their vehicle may operate. The default rules allow a driving automation system to properly operate when rules are not posted, or the physical sign is obstructed. Given the thousands of jurisdictions that exist in most countries, entering this data into a driving automation system quickly becomes a large barrier to deployment and maintenance.</p><p>Vehicles equipped with driving automation systems can also use sensors and logic to interpret traffic control devices. This is difficult due to the challenges faced by human drivers as described above. Nonetheless, it is required to ensure that temporary and dynamic rules are properly detected (e.g., reduced speed limits for road works). In addition, most vehicles with driving automation systems are not equipped with cameras with high enough resolution to properly decipher small font sizes that sometimes appear on signs (e.g., giving details about the applicable times for the rule). Given the current state of practice, every driving automation system must be designed to learn and follow laws and rules across thousands of jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Management of Electronic Transport Regulations (METR) intends to improve the current situation by specifying a trustworthy means of exchanging machine-interpretable transport-related rules.&nbsp;</p>"

                  "justification": "<p>There are many rules that have been defined by rule makers. While many of these rules are relatively static others can change with little notice. METR user systems need an accurate representation of rules at every point in time (e.g., on the scale of 0.1 second resolution) to make appropriate DDT decisions. Since the bulk of rules are relatively static, it would be very inefficient to download all defined rules 10 times a second; instead, the METR ConOps divides rules into two basic types: rules that have not changed recently are defined as \"pre-announced\" and recently added or changed rules are defined as \"emergent\".</p><p>The distinction between these two categories is based on the freshness period of relevant rule sets. When the new rule emerges, the associated rule sets must be updated; however, previously distributed copies of these rule sets will not contain the new rule. The new rule is considered \"emergent\" until the expiry time of all previously distributed rule sets have been reached. If the emergent rule becomes active during this time, the METR network is required to provide mechanisms to distribute the rule to all relevant users.</p>",

In the worse-case scenario, an ADS-equipped vehicle (level 3-5) without built-in input devices might stop and wait for a remote operator to assist in its navigation of the area. Such a scenario would likely degrade the efficiency of traffic operations in the area due to the temporarily stopped vehicle and restrictions imposed on remotely operated vehicles. To avoid this scenario, distributors can ensure that they tightly define any areas with non-electronic rules and limit alerts about non-electronic rules to those specific areas.</span></p>",
