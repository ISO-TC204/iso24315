Road vehicles typically need regular maintenance (e.g., every 5,000 km) and are generally expected to have a lifespan of around 300,000 km [3]. With typical usage, most cars have a 10–20-year lifespan and are driven to a certified maintenance facility several times per year. However, some vehicle owners like performing routine maintenance themselves, in which case the vehicle might only visit a certified maintenance facility when required for an inspection (e.g., annually) – and as some jurisdictions do not require inspections, some vehicles may seldom if ever visit a certified maintenance facility.</p><p>If a vehicle is disabled, it can be towed to a facility. Due to the size and shape of vehicles, towing expenses can be significant, especially when located in remote areas. Thus, it is desirable to provide alternatives to towing when possible.

A consumer system can request rules for its immediate area or can specify a broad area (e.g., a route defined by its navigation system).</p></td><td><p>Distributor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Identify current rules</p></td><td><p>The <em>consumer system provider&nbsp;</em>[SOURCE: ISO 24315-1:2024, 3.3.1.5] is responsible for developing the code that will obtain all METR information that meets the needs of the METR user and determining which of the rules provided by the METR infrastructure components are current and within the constraints of the user's request (e.g., the METR infrastructure components can provide a rule set that contains rules beyond that currently needed by the user).</p></td><td><p>Consumer system provider</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Identify relevant rules</p></td><td><p>The adapter is responsible for merging the current rules obtained from the consumer system with the appropriate supporting data to determine which rules are active and relevant to the user. For example, the consumer system will inform the adapter of current rules about how to behave in the presence of an emergency vehicle with its emergency lights engaged. Such a rule is only active when such a vehicle is in the immediate vicinity. &nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Adapter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Implement rules</p></td><td><p>The <em>rule implementer</em> [SOURCE: ISO 24315-1:2024, 3.3.1.22] is responsible for ensuring that the public is properly informed of the rules established by rule makers. For general rules, this can be achieved by properly recording information in the public record. For location-specific rules, this is typically achieved through the use of TCDs.</p></td><td><p>Rule implementer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Make rules</p></td><td><p>The rule maker is responsible for establishing rules and having agreements with a rule implementer to ensure that these rules are properly publicized.</p></td><td><p>Rule maker</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Monitor supporting data</p></td><td><p>The METR user is responsible for being aware of current conditions sufficiently to know when posted rules apply. For example, a driver is responsible for being aware when there is a posted night-time speed limit and whether it is currently in effect based on current conditions. While this does not require the use of METR, it is the responsibility of the operator to operate the vehicle based on all information sources received.</p></td><td><p>METR user</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Produce electronic supporting data</p></td><td><p>The supporting data provider is responsible for converting supporting data into electronic formats so that it can be distributed and easily processed by other METR components. Supporting data covers a wide range of environmental properties that can be monitored in a multitude of ways. For example, time and location could be determined using a GNSS receiver while monitoring for the presence of precipitation can use on-board sensors, the current state of windshield wipers, or information from the Internet.</p></td><td><p>Supporting data provider</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Operate vehicle</p></td><td><p>The METR user is responsible for using METR information to perform whatever tasks that is desired while complying with the provided rules. This function is entitled \"operate vehicle\" on the basis that this is the typical task that this document envisions, but how the METR user uses the information provided is outside the scope of this document (e.g., the METR user could be a passenger that is complying with rules related to where to board a public transport vehicle).</p></td><td><p>METR user</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Present relevant rules</p></td><td><p>The adapter is responsible for presenting relevant rules to the METR user in a format and style that is convenient and useful. This includes determining what information to provide when as well as how to provide this information. For example, if the METR user is a driver, it can be appropriate for the adapter to provide limited information on the dashboard based on likely real-time needs; if the METR user is a driving automation system, it is likely appropriate for the adapter to provide all of the relevant information in an electronic format.</p></td><td><p>Adapter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Report discrepancies</p></td><td><p>The discrepancy handler is responsible for notifying the relevant translators once sufficient discrepancy reports have been received from the field.</p></td><td><p>Discrepancy handler</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Report system-generated discrepancies</p></td><td><p>It is the responsibility of each component of the trusted METR infrastructure to perform consistency checks on the rules received from translators and to report discrepancies when discovered. Translators are assumed to have a limited scope of rules available; it is the responsibility of each connected system to contribute to the trustworthiness of the data maintained by the <em>METR system of systems (SoS)</em> [SOURCE: ISO 24315-1:2024, 3.3.2.10].</p></td><td><p>Distributor, Other translators, Discrepancy handler</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Report unverified discrepancies</p></td><td><p>It is the responsibility of each consumer system to report discrepancies as they are detected. It is recognized that temporary anomalies can cause individual METR users to erroneously detect discrepancies (e.g., due to obstructions and other phenomena). Each consumer system is expected to report the discrepancies that they detect, and the discrepancy handler will use crowd-sourcing techniques to suppress reports that appear to be erroneous.</p></td><td><p>Consumer system provider</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Resolve discrepancies</p></td><td><p>Once a discrepancy is reported to the translator, the translator becomes responsible for resolving the discrepancy. Depending on the discrepancy details, this can require investigations of the status of posted TCDs or coordination with public agencies or other translators. Once the investigation identifies the cause of the discrepancy, the translator is responsible for ensuring corrective action is taken and that proper guidance is provided to METR users until the necessary corrections are made.</p></td><td><p>Translator</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Translate into electronic rules</p></td><td><p>The translator is responsible for translating the legal rules into electronic rules. Ideally, the legal rules are written in a format that is METR-friendly so that the translation can be performed with no ambiguity.</p></td><td><p>Translator</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Update external systems</p></td><td><p>Discrepancy reports can be the result of systems external to METR. For example, a consumer system can have a bug that erroneously issues a discrepancy report under some condition where no discrepancy exists. When this is discovered, the translator needs to be able to contact the developer of the offending system so that the bug can be corrected.</p></td><td><p>Discrepancy Contact</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Verify electronic rules</p></td><td><p>Local policies can require that translated rules are independently verified prior to being signed. The verification task simply ensures that the translated rule is semantically identical to the legal rule. Having an independent body that specializes in this task can be useful to ensure that a translation problem that has been discovered in one jurisdictional area is not duplicated in another

Some of the routes include sections that do not yet have all the required rules in electronic form. The navigation system displays the various routes for Klaus, in order based on overall efficiency, which balances the desire to minimize total trip time while maximizing the percent of time spent with the ADS engaged. Once Klaus selects the route selection, the navigator requests the METR receiver to retrieve the rule sets for the entire route, contacting multiple distributors, if necessary. The scope of rules requested include both the ADS-controlled parts as well as the sections for which Klaus will be responsible.</p><p>When the ADS is in control, it is equipped with sufficient operational autonomy to deviate from its pre-defined route when necessary to avoid breaking any rules. If the ADS detects options (e.g., among two alternate paths), it may prompt Klaus for input, providing him with alternatives such as a longer fully automated route vs. a shorter route that has sections where Klaus must drive.

Once payment is confirmed and Bilo's visit is approved, the electronic permit is downloaded to the on-board computer and the on-board computer notifies both the ADS and the METR receiver of the newly received permit. The METR receiver then downloads additional rules for operating inside of the parking lot based on presenting the new certificate.</p><p>As the vehicle reaches the parking lot, it discovers it is controlled by a gate. The on-board computer presents its permit electronically to the gate controller and is granted access without interfering with the METR receiver.</p><p>As the vehicle enters the parking lot for which it has a permit, the ADS continues to control the vehicle, but in this case, the prevailing limiting speed limit is one defined by the vehicle's OEM. Although the university parking lot has a speed limit of 25 kph, the ADS is equipped with internal logic that limits its speed in parking lots to 20 kph. The METR receiver is constantly integrating all the rules it has (e.g., from national, regional, local, campus, fleet, OEM) and provides the resultant rules (i.e., typically the most restrictive rules) to the ADS, which applies them in its performance of the DDT.</p>"},"changedBy":{"company":"Trevilon","email":"kvaughn@trevilon.com","name":"Kenneth Vaughn"},"changedOn":"2024-05-17T21:43:14.387Z"}]},{"id":"280","guid":"9f3827b0-383a-45e0-9837-5adcf1786c44","heading":"Micromobility and VRUs","text":"<p>Once parked, Bilo exits his vehicle and realizes that he is still some distance from his scheduled meeting location, and he is running late.
